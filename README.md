# Colie_RPC
After learning Netty, I decided to write a lightweight RPC framework based on Netty, Zookeeper, and Spring. I have gained a lot. However, I am a ignorant person, so it is inevitable that there are some omissions. If you have any criticisms and suggestions, please send them to moxiongsen2022@gmail.com
